Python Data Analytics Project ðŸ“Š
This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics project implemented in Python. The project focuses on extracting insights from data through various techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Leveraging libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful charts and graphs.
Feature Engineering: Enhancing data features to improve model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms using Scikit-learn to build and evaluate models.
This project is a part of my ongoing efforts to build a solid foundation in data analytics and showcase my skills in Python. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or a potential employer, feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even collaborate!

This description highlights the essential aspects of the project and gives a clear overview of what others can expect to find in the repository.
